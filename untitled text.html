		<h1> Hello World</h1>
		
			<h2> A Place I would like to visit</h2>
			
			<p> A place I would like to visit is Italy. Italy has so many sites to see
			and so much history that makes it an intriguing place. I would like to see the 
			how te Italians way of life is. I know that they are very high standard and I 
			am very interested in going to Italy and staying there for a while.</p>
			
				<h2> A person I admire</h2>
				
				<p> A person that I admire is Mike Trout of the Los Angelas Angels of 
				Anaheim. He is a remarkable athlete and he is very humble about about his 
				success. He plays the game hard every time like it is the last game he
				is going to play and that just shows the respect that he has for the game
				and the people that play alongside with him.</p>
